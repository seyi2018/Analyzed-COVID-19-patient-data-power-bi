# COVID-19 Patient Life Support Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the distribution of COVID-19 patients requiring life support, specifically supplementary oxygen and ventilatory support, with respect to gender and time. The analysis aims to identify potential patterns and disparities in the severity of COVID-19 outcomes between male and female patients over a three-month period (October, November, and December). The findings can contribute to a better understanding of how the virus affects different demographic groups and inform healthcare resource allocation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was compiled and presented in a report titled "DISTRUBUTION OF COVID 19 PATIIENTS ON LIFE SUPPORT"[cite: 1]. The data includes the following key information, aggregated by gender and month:

* **Month:** The month of the reported data (October, November, December)[cite: 2].
* **Gender:** The gender of the patients (Female, Male)[cite: 2].
* **Sum of New covid-19 cases:** The total number of new COVID-19 cases reported for that gender in that month[cite: 2].
* **Sum of Supplementary oxygen:** The total number of patients of that gender requiring supplementary oxygen in that month[cite: 2].
* **Sum of Ventilatory support:** The total number of patients of that gender requiring ventilatory support in that month[cite: 2].

The data was extracted and analyzed from the aforementioned report. The original source of the raw patient data used to compile this report is not explicitly stated within the provided document.

## Analysis Steps

The analysis involved examining and visualizing the provided data to identify trends and comparisons. The specific steps include:

1.  **Data Extraction:**

    * Extracted the relevant data from tables and charts within the "DISTRUBUTION OF COVID 19 PATIIENTS ON LIFE SUPPORT" report[cite: 2, 3, 4, 5].
2.  **Comparative Analysis of New COVID-19 Cases:**

    * Compared the total number of new COVID-19 cases between females and males across the three months[cite: 9].
    * Analyzed the month-wise distribution of new cases for each gender to identify any significant shifts[cite: 10].
    * Visualized the number of new COVID-19 cases by month and gender using a bar chart (as shown in the report)[cite: 3].
3.  **Analysis of Supplementary Oxygen Usage:**

    * Compared the total supplementary oxygen usage between females and males[cite: 6].
    * Visualized the distribution of supplementary oxygen usage by gender and month using a pie chart (as shown in the report)[cite: 4].
4.  **Analysis of Ventilatory Support Usage:**

    * Compared the number of patients on ventilatory support between females and males for each month[cite: 7].
    * Identified trends in ventilatory support usage for each gender over the three-month period[cite: 8].
    * Visualized the number of patients on ventilatory support by month and gender using a bar chart (as shown in the report)[cite: 5].
5.  **Overall Interpretation:**

    * Synthesized the findings from the analysis of new cases, supplementary oxygen usage, and ventilatory support usage to draw overall conclusions about potential gender-based differences in COVID-19 impact[cite: 11, 12, 13, 14].

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed several key findings:

* Females had a higher total number of new COVID-19 cases across the three months (42576: 33237)[cite: 9].
* Females had higher total supplementary oxygen usage across the three months (5244:4648)[cite: 6].
* Males had a higher number of patients on ventilatory support in October, but females had a higher number in November and December[cite: 7].
* The gap between males and females narrowed in November and December, suggesting a potential shift in the demographic distribution of patients requiring ventilatory support[cite: 8].
* Females had significantly more new cases in November, while males had more new cases in December[cite: 10].
* The trends in ventilatory support and new cases suggest a possible shift in the demographic distribution of patients over time, with females accounting for a larger proportion of patients in the later months (November and December)[cite: 13].

## Tools Used

* The data analysis and visualization were based on the data presented in the "DISTRUBUTION OF COVID 19 PATIIENTS ON LIFE SUPPORT" report[cite: 1]. The tools used to create the original report are not specified.

## Limitations

* The analysis is based on aggregated data presented in the report. Access to the original raw patient data would allow for more in-depth analysis.
* The report does not provide information on other factors that could influence the observed trends, such as age, comorbidities, or other demographic variables.
* The findings are specific to the population represented in the report and may not be generalizable to other populations.
* Further analysis and additional data would be needed to confirm these findings and understand the underlying factors driving these trends[cite: 15].
